# SecretMessage

This file contains a secret code in ASCII format. 
Without knowing each character code, the user must run the application in order to see the message. 
However, before seeing the message, the user must go through an interaction phase with the computer and enter in a key that the computer gives to the user.
This will then generate the "secret message" and also open up a surprise for the user.
